# Project Tasks

- [ ] Isolate core algorithms from each HTML file into pure-Python modules; write unit tests to freeze numerical behaviour.

- [ ] Add model registry and ensure polymorphic dispatch via framework router.
- [ ] Wrap with Flask/FastAPI endpoints, wiring pydantic (FastAPI) or Marshmallow (Flask) schemas.

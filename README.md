## Features

- **Interactive Data Fitting**: Real-time parameter adjustment with immediate visual feedback
- **Djordjevic-Sarkar Model**: Implementation of the Djordjevic Sarkar model for material characterization
- **Fit Quality Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics to assess fit quality with visual indicators
- **Multiple Export Options**: Download results as a zip for CSV, PNG plots, JSON reports, and evaluation metrics
- **Browser-Based**: No installation required - runs entirely in your web browser using Pyodide
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and tablet devices

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmeddeb/QuickFitter.git
cd QuickFitter
```

2. Serve the application locally:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
OR double click on index.html

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

4. Upload your CSV file with columns: `Frequency (GHz)`, `Dk`, `Df`

## Input Data Format

Your CSV file should have three columns:
- **Frequency (GHz)**: Measurement frequency in gigahertz
- **Dk**: Dielectric constant (real part of permittivity)
- **Df**: Dissipation factor (loss tangent)

Example:
```csv
Frequency (GHz),Dk,Df
1.0,3.45,0.002
2.0,3.42,0.003
5.0,3.38,0.005
```

## Models

### Currently Implemented
- **Djordjevic-Sarkar Model**: A wideband model for frequency-dependent dielectric materials
  - Parameters: ï¿½, ï¿½ï¿½, fï¿½, fï¿½
  - Suitable for: Materials with frequency-dependent permittivity and loss

### Coming Soon
- **Debye Model**: For materials with single relaxation time
- **Cole-Cole Model**: For materials with distributed relaxation times
- **Havriliak-Negami Model**: For asymmetric relaxation processes
- **Multi-pole Models**: For complex material systems
- **Custom Model Support**: Upload your own model equations

## Fit Quality Metrics

QuickFitter evaluates your fit using multiple metrics:
- **Reduced Chi-Square**: Overall goodness of fit
- **RMS Errors**: For real and imaginary parts separately
- **Parameter Correlations**: To identify parameter dependencies
- **Data Points per Variable**: To ensure statistical validity

## Output Files

The tool generates a comprehensive results package:
- `*_fitted.csv`: Fitted data points
- `*_plot.png`: Publication-ready plot
- `*_report.txt`: Detailed fit report
- `*_report.json`: Machine-readable results
- `*_evaluation.md`: Fit quality assessment

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, Tailwind CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (via Pyodide in browser)
- **Scientific Libraries**: NumPy, SciPy, lmfit, Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Build**: No build process required - runs directly in browser
